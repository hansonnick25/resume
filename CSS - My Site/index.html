        <p>I became interested in coding when I was 8 years old. My father was a programmer before he retired and together we wanted to learn how to make video games. I've had a great time learning, but still haven't made that blockbuster video
          game... yet.</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>I learned to cook from my mother as soon as I was old enough to see above the stove. I have a wealth of great memories of learning from and cooking with her, and I still love to feed as many people as I can.
